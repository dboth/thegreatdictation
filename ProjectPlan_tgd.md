The Great Dictation
===================

*Project plan*  
Authors: Dominik Both, Tobias Göbel, Svenja Lohse, Tonio Weidler  
Advisor: Magdalena Wolska  

About the Task
------
Our **goal** is a online dictation system for non-native speakers to support and excercise their listening and writing skills in a acquired second language (here german).
It will be important to motivate the learners and keep them motivated over the whole learning process.
Analyzing their mistakes, giving them constructive feedback and using the analysed data for improvement of our system - these are desirable steps to make our dictation plattform aka *The Great Dictation* awesome.

**Why dictation and listening comprehension?**  
Orthography or Spelling has to be exercised to enhance it.
Using auditive dictation and therefore listening comprehension plays a key role in facilitating language learning by coordinating between the discrimination between sounds, understanding of vocabulary and grammatical structures, as well as interpretation of stress and intonation for interpunction.
Also the students have greater motivation to continue learning because they can develope their listening skills and concentrate on internalizing grammar rules instead of additionally pressure of producing own text intonations while handling all the before mentioned processes in their heads. *(Vandergrift,1999)*
With dictation they do not only learn vocabulary, they also learn grammar while memorising meaning and relationship of words *(Alkire,2002)* and get some useful standard phrases. Afterwards they can review a list of their syntactic mistakes, get some advices for grammar rule repetition and keep track of their progress. *(Kazazoglu, 2012)*

So we have to *filter, sort, group and analyse* the mistakes, consistently *refine our algorithm* with given data, find a way to give positive and *motivating result feedback*, on the one hand build the whole platform on a *solid, extensible database* and on the other hand make it *interesting and userfriendly* in design and use.
