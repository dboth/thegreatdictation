The Great Dictation
===================

*Project plan*  
Authors: Dominik Both, Tobias GÃ¶bel, Svenja Lohse, Tonio Weidler  
Advisor: Magdalena Wolska  

About the Task
------
Our **goal** is an online dictation system for non-native speakers to support and exercise their listening and writing skills in an acquired second language (in our case German).
It will be important to motivate the learners and keep them in this state over the whole learning process.
Analysing their mistakes, giving them constructive feedback and using the analysed data for improvement of our system - these are the desirable steps to make our dictation platform, aka *The Great Dictation* awesome.

**Why dictation and listening comprehension?**  
Orthography or Spelling has to be exercised to enhance it.
Using auditive dictation and therefore listening comprehension plays a key role in facilitating language learning by coordinating the discrimination between sounds, understanding of vocabulary and grammatical structures, as well as interpretation of stress and intonation for punctuation.  
Furthermore the students have greater motivation to continue learning because they can develop their listening skills and concentrate on internalising grammar rules instead of additional pressure of producing own text intonations while handling all the before mentioned processes in their heads *(Vandergrift,1999)*.  
With dictation they do not only learn vocabulary, they also learn grammar while memorising meaning and relationship of words *(Alkire,2002)* and get some useful standard phrases. Afterwards they can review a list of their mistakes, get some advice for grammar rule repetition and keep track of their progress. *(Kazazoglu, 2012)*

To that end we have to *filter, sort, group and analyse* the mistakes, consistently *refine our algorithm* with given data, find a way to give positive and *motivating result feedback*, on the one hand build the whole platform on a *solid, extensible database* and on the other hand make it *interesting and user friendly* in design and use.

System architecture and modules
----
With the former in mind the composition of said system has to be constructed to fullfil the needed requirements. 

In web development an application is usually parted in two modules: The server sided *backend* and the client sided *frontend*.  
The **backend** serves as the *main controller* of the application and functions as a *connector* between the database and the application. The **frontend** represents the *viewpoint of the user* and officiates as the *interface between human and computer*. 

This general model can be utilised for our application as well. However, we decided to bisect the backend to separate the **standard backend** - comprising *page generation* and *user administration system* - from the **analysis backend**, containing the *computational lingustic analysis* itself. Thus we can dispose of different programming languages for each section of the backend, allowing us to combine the time efficience of PHP in building web application backends and the effectivity of Python in linguistic analysis.

In conclusion there are three components:
* Frontend
* Management backend
* Analysis backend

Data
----
It is in the nature of our task that there is *no data* available upfront. Therefore we need to collect the data ourselves. To that end our system is designed to *collect data* while it *expands its features*.  
To provide an incentive, the **version zero** already contains a small analysis that expands by using the data it collects.

Schedule and concrete Distribution of Tasks
----
We divided the accrued tasks according to the special skills each of us brings in.

**Main Responsibilities**:  
*Dominik*: Backend-Development, Database Management

*Tobias*: Analysing-Algorithms, kind of mistakes  

*Svenja*: Didatic background of dictation/listening comprehension and feedback/result (research)  

*Tonio*: Frontend-Development, Database Management, Project Management

Although everybody participates in each section for minor tasks.


**Schedule**:  
-> See a much more detailed version of the schedule in the folder *roadmap*  
**01.12.15** v0 and project plan finished  
**08.12.15** start of data collection  
*...analysis features, result feedback, platform design, fancy stuff*   
**02.02.16**  version with features finished, final presentation
