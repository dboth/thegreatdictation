                <p><b>You may want to know why you should use this dictation platform, weâ€™ll tell you:</b>
                </p>
                <p>Orthography or spelling has to be exercised to enhance it. Using this auditive dictation and therefore <em>listening comprehension</em> plays a key role in facilitating language learning.
                </p>
                <p>Your brain will learn
                        <ul>
                                <li>to discriminate between sounds,</li>
                                <li>vocabulary and grammatical structures,</li>
                                <li>to interprete stress and intonation for interpunction.</li>
                        </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Also you, the student, will better get motivated to continue learning because you can develope your listening skills and concentrate on internalizing the heard grammar rules instead of getting additional pressure of producing your own text intonations - while handling all the before mentioned processes in your heads <sub>(Vandergrift,1999)</sub>.
                With dictation you do not only learn vocabulary, you also learn grammar while memorising meaning and relationship of words <sub>(Alkire,2002)</sub> and you will get some useful standard phrases.
                Afterwards you can review a list of your syntactic mistakes, get some advices for repeat required learning material to get better and you also keep track of your progress <sub>(Kazazoglu, 2012)</sub>.
