<p>The frontend determines, which informations it needs to receive from the backend to show the user what he wants to see. It also asks the user for information to send to the backend.</p>
<p>To define, what the user sees in his browser, <em>HTML</em> and <em>CSS</em> (SASS as a preprocessor) are used to structure and style the content. Several Javascript scripts handle page events like actions by the user and process the data received from the backend to show it to the user in an appropriate and appealing way.</p>
<p><em>The Great Dictation</em> is usable on multiple plattforms including mobile devices and therefore fully responsible. This means it design dynamically adapts to the users screensize. We implemented this responsiveness via <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, a framework that consists of HTML, CSS and JS Components, providing a useful Grid Structure and several other functionalities. This framework was customized, such that it fits the project. With <strong>jQuery</strong> we included a common framework that simplifies many processes in JS. Charts are created with the help of <strong>ChartJS</strong>, one of the most famous libraries in this area. It not only displays the charts but also provides the user interactivity (tooltips).</p>
<p>Pages are build by reusable components that get plugged into page layouts which themselves are loaded into the main template. This way we can reuse the same template for all pages and reuse components like the result in different pages. One of the main concerns of this projects frontend is how to display the results of the dictations.</p>
