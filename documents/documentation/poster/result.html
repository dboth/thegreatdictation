<p>The data calculated by the backends analysis components is processed by the frontend to show the user informations and statistics about his errors and performance.</p>
<p>In the <strong>What you've entered</strong> Section the user gets presented the whole text as how he typed it in. Where he made mistakes the word is highlighted in a color representing the weight of the error.</p>
<p>The <strong>Error Distribution</strong> shows how the users characterwise mistakes are distributed over the different mistake groups. Those are created by categorizing the <em>Aligners</em> error types as follows: <em>correct, waste, missing, wrong, switched, capitalization, punctuation, similar punctuation</em> and <em>word switch</em>. This distribution can be either displayed as a radar chart or as a bar chart. The current dictation is compared to the users average values. </p>
<p>The <strong>Rating</strong> consists of the ratio of correct and total words in this dictation and a score for the dictation. The score is calculated as a value between 0 and 100 representing the <em>correctness</em> of the users input. It considers the weight of errors and the word lengths.</p>
<p>A <strong>Detailed character by character error info</strong> shows the words with mistakes again by exactly revealing where the mistakes were made and how to correct them.</p>
<p>The line chart under the section <strong>Performance over time</strong> shows how the errorweight of the levenshtein path develops over the text (word-wise).</p>
<p>All past dictations can be reviewed under <em>Your Dictations</em>, where the same informations will be showed again. Average values and statistics about all dictations can be looked up under <em>Statistics</em>.</p>
