				<h4>Here we tell you about <strong class="pointout">the great team</strong> behind <em>"The Great Dictation"</em>:</h4>
				<p>Once upon a time there was a software project from subject of <strong class="pointout">computional linguistics</strong> at <em>Karl-Ruprecht-University Heidelberg</em>.<br>
				Four <em class="pointout">wonderful and creative</em> students got a project idea about how to make learning with dictation <strong class="pointout">awesome</strong> for foreigners,<br>
				so they started to <strong class="pointout">research</strong> and <strong class="pointout">program</strong> and <strong class="pointout">design</strong> this whole platform.<br>
				And if they didn't finished this <strong class="pointout">great project</strong> they're still working on it.</p>
