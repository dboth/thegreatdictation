				<h3><strong>Test version - What is that and why?</strong> </h3>
				<p>You are using a <strong class="pointout">test version</strong> - it means: <br>
				Right now we got a quite "easy" <em>analysis</em> to check how your written text differs from the original. </p>
				<p>We need to <strong class="pointout">collect data</strong> about different kind of mistakes and levels of difficulty to see where we have to enhance our analysis algorithms and to give you <em>helpful result feedback</em>.</p>

				<h3><strong>How to use it?</strong></h3>

                    <!-- some arrows connecting text and pics-->
